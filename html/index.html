        <h2>About TFTPy</h2>
        <p>TFTPy is a pure Python implementation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol">Trivial FTP protocol</a>.</p>
        <p>I wrote it because the VoIP company that I work for uses
        TFTP to pull firmware loads for our sets, and at times when this
        doesn't work we use a Windows-based diagnostic tool to troubleshoot
        the connection.</p>
        <p>As all of the computers in my home run some flavour of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebsd">FreeBSD</a>,
        this tool wasn't much use to me, so I started one of my own.
        I decided to use <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
        since it's comfortable and available for the platforms that I care
        about, and was surprised to not find a pre-existing TFTP library for
        it. So, I wrote one, and here it is.  It's not 1.0 yet, but
        downloading is production-ready IMHO, as some of the people using it
        tell me.</p>

        <a name="features" />
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>At this time, it supports the following RFCs:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1350.html">1350</a>
                The TFTP Protocol, revision 2 (downloads only, octet mode only)
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2347.html">2347</a>
                TFTP Option Extension
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2348.html">2348</a>
                TFTP Blocksize Option
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2349.html">2349</a>
                TFTP Timeout Interval and Transfer Size Options (just the
                tsize option right now)
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <a name="plans" />
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>I do have plans for this code before a 1.0 release, including the
        following:
        <ul>
            <li>Complete overhaul of the internal state machine.</li>
            <li>Full RFC 1350 compliance, including netascii mode (I could
            care less about "mail" mode), and uploads (uploads are
            experimental right now and are on the "upload-patch" branch on
            Github).</li>
            <li>Symmetric UDP support. I don't know of an RFC for this but
            it's a no-brainer for NAT traversal. In this mode the server
            should always respond on the port that the RRQ was sent to, so
            stateful firewalls will permit the response.</li>
            <li>Documentation!</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <a name="code" />
        <h2>The Code</h2>
        <p>You can find the latest release at the SourceForge
        <a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/tftpy/">Project Page</a>, as a
        source tarball. It should also be in <a
        href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPi</a>, so you can use
        easy_install if you prefer.</p>

        <p>The latest code though is always on the master branch
        in <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>. I did use SVN in
        SourceForge for a while, but after discovering Git I couldn't go back.
        To clone the repository, run the following command using git
        <pre>
    git clone git://github.com/msoulier/tftpy.git
        </pre>
        Patches welcome, even if I can't guarantee response time. You can
        of course send me the url of a public git repository to pull from
        as well.</p>

        <p>The Github project page is <a
        href="http://github.com/msoulier/tftpy/tree/master">right
        here</a>.</p>
        </p>

        <a name="support" />
        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>SourceForge doesn't make the mailing list easy to find, so
        <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tftpy-general">here
        is a direct link</a> if you'd like to join.</p>
        <p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:msoulier@digitaltorque.ca">email
        me</a> with any questions, or contact me through github. I'm also
        "msoulier" in <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a>.</p>
