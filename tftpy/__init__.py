"""
This library implements the tftp protocol, based on rfc 1350.
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1350.html
At the moment it implements only a client class, but will include a server,
with support for variable block sizes.

As a client of tftpy, this is the only module that you should need to import
directly. The TftpClient and TftpServer classes can be reached through it.
